# Memory Game Project

## Intro
The Memory Game project is a card matching game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, there have been added a couple of dependencies:

Some icons used in the game are coming from Font Awesome;
The page is styled with Coda Font Family from Google Fonts.

It is usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

##Instructions
There are 16 cards (8 pairs) and all of them are laid down and randomly mixed. The aim of the game is to find all pairs of cards by turning over two cards at the time.

## Feedback

Please feel free to suggest or add any comment that could improve the functionality (..and, why not, also the style of the code)! That'd be really appreciated!
